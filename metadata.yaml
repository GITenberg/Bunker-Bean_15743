description: Bunker Bean consults a psychic who tells him that in previous lives he
  was a number of famous figures (among them, Napoleon Bonaparte and an Egyptian prince).
  With this new knowledge he lives his life with a new confidence. In the end he discovers
  that the woman was a fake and that all of the success he has gained in his life
  is only the result of his own actions.
